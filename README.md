# Angular Fruit

A small web application where users can purchase their favourite fruit.

### Motivation

I thought the best way to learn the fundamentals of Angular was to create an application. I needed a project idea that wasn't too ambitious, but would explore common problems when developing a web application. To spice things up, I decided to use Webpack instead of the common RequireJS and Bower combination.
